* [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
  * [Training Set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
  * Used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with back propagation to train the network & predict the result.
  * The ANN has Input layer of size 784 (number of pixels in an image), There is single Hidden layer of size 40. and the output 
  layer is of size 10 (number of results i.e 0-9)
  * The network was trained for 40 Epochs.
  * The resultant network achieved an efficiency of 94.6%
